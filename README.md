# Duck Season


Duck season is a game of bird hunting, on the screen the ducks appear and the player has to hover over the duck to shoot and hunt the duck. There are two rounds in the game, menu and pause scene. There is no way to win, the game is just about making the best score.

There are two kinds of birds, the simple ones and the phoenixes. Simple birds just fly across the screen and phoenixes don't leave the screen they keep bouncing around until the player kills them.
